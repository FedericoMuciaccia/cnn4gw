    "\n",
    "Direct detection of gravitational wave is now a reality [4].\n",
    "Gravitational waves will open a new era of astronomy observations, extracting invaluable astrophysical informations from data that cannot be collected in other ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years there have been different efforts to elaborate pipelines to search for continuous signals [2], such as the wave emitted by a rapidly spinning neutron star which is not perfectly symmetric around its spin axis [3]. As an example, a bulge of height $\\mathcal{O}(1 cm)$ across the surface of a neutron star ($\\sim 20 km$ in diameter) within 2000 light years from us will leave a detectable gravitational signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gravitational transients are much more elusive, even in their possible theoretical explanations [3] [8]. For example, here's a list of some possible sources:\n",
    "* spinning instabilities in the formation of a protoneutron star\n",
    "* clumps in a turbolent accretion disk following a stellar collapse\n",
    "* r-mode oscillations following pulsar glitches\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual time durations of all these possible transients are still highly debated in the literature (ranging from milliseconds to months). That's mainly because of our model's deficiencies [3] and the intrinsic complexity of the physical processes involved (eg:turbolence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, ther's the need for a clean and hierarchical model-independent search, purely based on observational data at different scales. That need is also strengthened by the historical detection already mentioned above [4], because in that case the signal parameters were outside the known physics and it was crucial to have very robust algorithms, even if less sensitive.\n"

    "For every temporal bin, the output of the Fourer transform is the amplitude spectrad density $S_h(\\nu)$. As will be discussed in the next session, this spectrum is full of peaks and strong dishomogeneities, so a form of data equalization is needed: this normalization operation is called _whitening_ because the desired result is a flat spectrum (white noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"whiten\" the data, we divide each output of the Fourier transform by the noise amplitude spectrum, which is obtained averaging 32 s of the data in the Fourier domain, because this data average is completely dominated by instrumental noise.\n",

    "Then a $2.5 \\sigma$ threshold is imposed, discarding everything smaller than this level. This value of the threshold is optimized for continuous signals, so it is suboptimal in the case of transients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of recording all the values above $2.5 \\sigma$, only the local maxima are saved. This turns out to improve fit reliability and resience to undesired fluctuations in the case of real noise, but again is suboptimal in the case of pure gaussian white noise (see below).\n",

    "Dealing with the real noise seems too hard, at least at the beginning, because it is nonstationar and there are structures (lines) in the noise tha can easily be misclassified as signals. There are also many temporal slices with missing data. Sometimes those missing data are flagged, as for example when a train passed nearby, but some others are not, for example when the interferometer looses its _lock_ (working posision) due to an unexpected external perturbation.\n",
